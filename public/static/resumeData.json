    "bio": "Hi there! I'm Aylon. After earning my Master's degree in Interface Design, I studied and worked with ASP.NET, and PHP. For the past six years, my focus was all flavors of JavaScript: React, Next.js, Vue, Node.js, and Angular 16. I've architected systems with databases like SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I've written backend REST APIs to expose databases to the frontend. I've coded the frontend using CSS, SCSS, HTML5, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, React, Redux, Vue.js, or Angular to achieve pixel-perfect design on the one hand, and build business logic and user experience on the other.I've worked alone or within international teams, using Git to share code and Jira or ClickUp to follow project plans and meet deadlines. I've held daily meetings over Zoom or Meet, and bi-weekly sprints to fix bugs or add new features. I've worked on SaaS applications that are built for thousands of users on a network of Dockers using Kubernetes on clouds like AWS or Azure, or even smaller projects with Google Firebase.I enjoy the challenge of constantly learning and applying new knowledge to real projects to meet client requirements and needs. I always enjoy coding in pairs or receiving code reviews. And of course, when my work is published online and used by millions of users, it fills me with pride.",
    "bio2": "One of my first major projects was to create a multimedia interactive experience for the Columbus Center of Marine Biology in Baltimore. I used Adobe Authorware, the only compatible software at the time, and a network of SPARC stations. The experience was a museum tour that was monitored by interactive kiosks along the way. Students could use SPARC stations to participate in the tour. These computers, which were popular in the early 1990s, provided information about marine life and tracked students' progress through the museum.",
    "bio3": "I am also a certified EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) practitioner and NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming) life coach. I worked in a Healing Center in Bangkok for 2 years.",
    "bio4": "Moreover, I enjoyed 7 years as an Interior Designer and a Landlord, renovating and renting out studio apartments in Bangkok.",
