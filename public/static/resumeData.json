    "bio": "I like to use technology to improve processes. And since my Master's degree in Multimedia, I have worked as a programmer for many advertising companies from New York and San Francisco to Bangkok and Tel Aviv.",
    "bio2": "One of my first major projects was to create a multimedia interactive experience for the Columbus Center of Marine Biology in Baltimore. I used Adobe Authorware, the only compatible software at the time, and a network of SPARC stations. The experience was a museum tour that was monitored by interactive kiosks along the way. Students could use SPARC stations to participate in the tour. These computers, which were popular in the early 1990s, provided information about marine life and tracked students' progress through the museum.",
    "bio3": "On one hand I enjoyed working with CEOs to bring their vision into a working web application, while on the other working within international teams, all from the comfort of my home office. I was proud to work with Microsoft even if it was a short project. I gain a lot of experience with many new technologies and the agile way of working in those big hightech companies. I also like to work directly with the business owners who need help to improve the way they get new clients, providing them with good marketing and landing pages on one hand and chatbots, AI and automation on the other.",
    "bio4": "I really enjoy building smart video robots, AI agents that improve the process of acquiring new customers leading to more clients, more profits.",
